# 🏟 GFL League Engine – Global Fusion League Simulation System

The **Global Fusion League (GFL)** is an AI-powered, fully simulated international sports league featuring 8 branded teams, dynamic match outcomes, cinematic highlights, and betting integration logic.

This repo contains the simulation engine, rulebook logic, and modular tools powering **Game Master Mode** — the core behind GFL’s player stat modeling, prop simulation, and media-ready content flow.

## 🌍 League Overview

- 8 global franchises: Rio Blaze, New York Halo, Berlin Core, Cairo Pulse, Tokyo Shifters, Nairobi Stride, Sydney Spectra, Seoul Tempest
- Round-robin regular season → Best-of-3 playoffs → Championship showdown
- Gender-neutral league with unified rulebook and hybrid sport format

---

## 🧠 Game Master Mode (Core Engine)

Game Master Mode is GFL’s custom simulation system that includes:

### 🎮 Match Simulation Logic
- Player stamina, scoring zones, defense pressure, and ball momentum
- AI outcome generation with randomness + weighted stat probability
- Positional logic for shot selection, passes, and turnovers

### 🔁 In-Game Prop Simulation
- 1+ Score, 2+ Impact Plays, Defensive Swings, MVP odds
- Tracked by possession, quarter, and full-game loops

### 🎞 Highlight Script Generator
- Automatically tags major moments (buzzer-beaters, blocks, momentum shifts)
- Formats event logs into narrative structure for AI voiceover tools

---

## 📊 League Rules Engine

- Possession-based hybrid format (soccer + basketball mechanics)
- 4 quarters, 8 minutes each
- Shot clock system, zone fouls, scoring arcs
- Balanced team roles: Attacker / Mid / Defender / Specialist

## 🎥 Media Flow (GFL Content Engine)

Designed for use with AI video generators (e.g., Sora, Runway, Pika):

- Highlight sequencing
- Logo overlays and motion templates
- Match stat cards and MVP showcases
- Team intro segments + sponsor bumpers
