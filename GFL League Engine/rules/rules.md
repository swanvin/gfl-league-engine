## 🧩 Game Format

| Element | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Teams** | 2 teams of 5 players (Attacker, Midfield, Defender, Flex, Specialist) |
| **Duration** | 4 Quarters, 8 minutes each |
| **Possessions** | 6 possessions per team per quarter |
| **Timeouts** | 1 per half, 30 seconds each |
| **Overtime** | Sudden-death: First to 3 points |

---

## 🎯 Scoring System

| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Standard Goal (inner zone) | 2 pts |
| Arc Shot (outer edge) | 3 pts |
| Momentum Combo (3+ possessions) | Bonus 1 pt |
| Interception-to-Goal Sequence | 1 Bonus pt |

---

## 🔁 Possession Rules

- Possession alternates after each attempt (make or miss)
- Steals or deflections count as turnover possessions
- No shot clock, but “Stall Warnings” issued after 10 seconds

---

## 🛡 Zones & Roles

- **Scoring Arc**: 3-point perimeter
- **Flex Zone**: Midcourt area controlled by the Flex player
- **Specialist Zone**: Where shot blockers and disruptors rotate

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Attacker | Primary scorer, drives & finishes |
| Midfield | Playmaker + perimeter shooter |
| Defender | Blocks, intercepts, zone coverage |
| Flex | Swings between offense & defense |
| Specialist | High-risk/high-reward wildcard (power shots, saves, traps) |

---

## ⚠️ Foul System

| Foul Type | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Contact Foul | Ball turns over to opponent |
| Technical Foul | -1 pt and loss of next possession |
| Zone Violation | Warning → automatic 2 pts if repeated |

**3 technicals** = player ejected  
**4 fouls total** = auto-substitution (simulated)

---

## 🔄 Substitution Rules

- Unlimited between quarters
- Forced sub if:
  - Player commits 4 fouls
  - Fatigue rating drops below 30%

---

## 🔮 Simulation-Based Variables

- **Clutch Trait**: Boosts accuracy in final 2 minutes
- **Momentum Shifts**: 3+ score streak = stat boost
- **Player Focus**: Impacts foul rate and accuracy
- **Fatigue System**: Lowers accuracy and speed over time
